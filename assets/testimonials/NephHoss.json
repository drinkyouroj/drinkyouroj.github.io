  "testimonial_full": "My first impressions of Justin was that he was a smart guy, but more importantly he was kind with his knowledge, going out of his way to help others when it didn't benefit him.\n\nLater in both remote and in-person professional settings, Justin consistently went above and beyond, completing both technically advanced and simple tasks. From troubleshooting Linux issues online, to interfacing with customers in person — Justin shines in both high level and get-your-hands-dirty work.\n\nHe's friendly, hardworking, creative in his solutions, he takes initiative, and he's humble enough to ask and learn when he doesn't know an answer.\n\nGiven the opportunity I would hire him myself, so I can confidently recommend Justin for any support or sysadmin role.",
